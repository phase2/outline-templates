# Outline Templates

This repository contains a `packages` directory. Each directory within `packages` represents a unique package or template. Each template is a fully functional frontend project scaffolding, designed to integrate with various frontend technologies and tools.

## Storybook Template

The initial template we are starting with is the `storybook` template. This template integrates Outline with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), a popular tool for developing UI components in isolation. This integration allows for a streamlined development and testing process for Outline components within the Storybook environment.

## Possible Future Templates

In the future, we plan to expand the range of templates available. Here are some possibilities:

### Astro

An [Astro](https://astro.build/) based documentation system template could provide a robust platform for creating comprehensive documentation for Outline components. Astro's performance-focused approach to building web applications could make this an excellent choice for large-scale documentation projects.

### React Template

A template for [React](https://reactjs.org/) applications could be beneficial for developers who want to leverage the power of React's component-based architecture with Outline components. This could provide a seamless integration experience for developers already working with React.

### Next.js Template

A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template could offer a solution for developers looking to build server-side rendered applications with Outline components. Next.js's hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more could make it a great fit for Outline.

### Angular Template

An [Angular](https://angular.io/) template could cater to developers who prefer Angular's comprehensive framework for building web applications. This template could provide a way to use Outline components within Angular's powerful ecosystem.

### Yext Template

A template for [Yext](https://www.yext.com/) could be useful for developers building location-based search experiences. This template could provide a way to use Outline components within Yext's Pages platform, enhancing the user interface of local search experiences.

### Other Modern Systems

As the landscape of frontend development continues to evolve, we aim to provide templates for other modern systems that emerge and prove to be beneficial for developers. This could include new JavaScript frameworks, libraries, or tools that align with the goals of the Outline project.
