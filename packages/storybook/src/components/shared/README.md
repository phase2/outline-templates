# Shared Components

This directory is dedicated to shared components that are commonly used across multiple parts of the application. These components are bundled together for easier distribution, testing, and usage.

Shared components typically include UI elements that are reused in various parts of the application. For example, buttons, form elements, headers, footers, and navigation bars. These components are generic and versatile enough to be used in various contexts and parts of the application.

However, not all components are suitable for this directory. Components that are specific to a certain feature or part of the application should not be included here. For instance, a component that displays a specific chart related to a specific feature of the application would not be a good fit for this directory. Such components are better placed in a directory specific to the feature or part of the application they belong to.

By organizing our components in this way, we can ensure that our codebase remains clean, organized, and easy to navigate. It also promotes code reuse and helps to keep our application's overall size and complexity in check.
