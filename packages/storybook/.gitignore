# Environment Variables

# While as a rule, .env files are not committed, we do use 
# .env files at types for some benign environment variables. 
# These are able to be committed as they do not contain any 
# sensitive information. The .env.local files, however, 
# contain sensitive information and should never be committed.
# 
# Remove the following line if you want to commit .env files
.env
.env.local

# Log Files
*.log

# Operating System Files
.DS_Store
