    To include the necessary assets for testing, you have several options:

    1. Full Production Bundle: This is the entire application bundled together. 
       You can include it by uncommenting the following line:
       <script src="dist/index.js" type="module"></script>

    2. Individual Components: If you want to test specific components, you can 
       import them individually. You'll need to know the path to the component 
       file in the 'dist' directory. For example:
       <script src="dist/components/your-component.js" type="module"></script>
       <script src="/src/components/your-component.ts" type="module"></script>

    3. Standard Includes: These are common files that are often needed in the 
       head tag. For example, a global stylesheet is included in this file:
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="public/global.css" />

    Remember to replace 'your-component' with the name of the component you want 
    to test. Also, ensure the paths to the files are correct relative to this 
    HTML file.
